  <h1>Sussy Mode</h1>
  <p>Coming soon. Maybe. Hopefully. Actually hopefully not.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Sussy Mode is a gamemode developed by DINOTICK (aka DINO) and Petar (aka Petra) Why are we making this? Because we were dropped as children!</p>
  <h2>What is Sussy Mode?</h2>
  <p>Why, what a terrible question! Sussy-Mode is the entirety of my stupid brain and the few brain cells I have left being put into a very dumb coding project that is very very normal and not at all cursed. Here at DINOTICK corperation we are very "serious" about our work. We take great pride making the dumbest things known to man. Basically this will be a mod for TF|2 +Northstar (Please, do check out Northstar if you haven't already. It is single-handedly saving a whole game.) We want to make this as stupid as possible. The end.</p>
